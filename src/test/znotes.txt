TO DO:

* Update solver capabilities in hypre_drive.c with updates in sstruct.c, etc.

* Maybe re-engineer the argv/argc stuff to create separate command-line strings
  instead.  This would allow us to move away from the requirement of spaces on
  either side of the brackets '{' and '}' (by either explicitly inserting spaces
  where they are needed, or parsing the strings differently).

* The help is still long and difficult to follow.  Think of alternative ideas.

* What about unit testing (for example, testing all Set/Get routines) and
  running with/without the solver defaults?

* Write some documentation on how the driver is organized and how new
  capabilities should be added.

* Update the regression tests.


NOTE: Keep the other drivers around to allow a more gradual transition to hypre_drive.


DONE * See 'RDF TODO' in hypre_drive.c to move krylov method logic to main()
DONE * Implement Krylov Solvers in hypre_solver.c (take code from hypre_solver_sstruct.c)
DONE * Implement hypre_solver_sstruct.c and other files
